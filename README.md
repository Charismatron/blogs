# Blogs

All my blogs in one spot:

* [Are language workbenches dead?](content/are-language-workbenches-dead.adoc)
* [Intentional Software bought by Microsoft](content/intentional-software-bought-by-microsoft.adoc)


## Rationale

I've been writing blogs for a couple of years, on both WordPress and Medium.
Both are OK for writing non-technical blogs, and OK-ish for writing technical blogs with code listings and such.

Having blogs on multiple outlets/platforms is not ideal.
I also don't like Medium's business model so much these days.
So, I decided to copy all my blogs into a GitHub repository.
That way, I have full control of the content, without relying on the nicety of free(-ish) platforms.

The disadvantage is that all existing comments and annotations on the blogs as they exist on WordPress and Medium are not going to be reproduced here.
Technically, I could take the effort, but I don't really see the point so much - also given that there's not many comments and annotations anyway.

If you're dying to leave a comment, you can either start a discussion, or an issue on GitHub, DM me, or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/meinte37).
